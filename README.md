# SUSTC_EE317_Android_applications
Some naive projects in EE317, 2023Spring. Besides, the ability of the programmer(myself) is...always doubtful, so take it easy then looking up to those mountain codes...

# Function

This is just a calculator. Including:

* $+~-~\times~\divide$ operators, and `get common divisor` `mod` followed.
* An instance of `BigDecimal.java`, providing ways for accurate calculating.
* Support science computation, which is naive.

Waiting for DALAO(intelligent person) to enhance it, if interested(anyone's really interested? hahahaha).
