# SUSTC_EE317_Android_applications

Some naive projects in EE317, 2023Spring. Besides, the ability of the programmer(myself) is...always doubtful, so take it easy then looking up to those mountain codes...

## Calculatore:

This is just a calculator. Including:

* $+~-~\times~\div$ operators, and `get common divisor` `mod` followed.
* An instance of `BigDecimal.java`, providing ways for accurate calculating.
* Support science computation, which is naive.

see folder `calculator`

## Music Player:

This is a music player for playing music emmm...

see folder `musicPlayer`
